## Thank you for using TOHE+!

## Fixes
- Fixed fatal error with Mercenary
- Fixed most of the random disconnects due to code failure (TOHRE bug)
- Fixed Head Hunder Kill Cooldown going below 0s
- Fixed the /kcount command
- Deleted role subcategories (they were causing issues in the settings panel)
- Fixed some roles' descriptions to match what the role actually does, with the changes in TOHE+
- Other minor bug fixes (there's a lot)
- Major overall performance improvement (now the only thing causing noticable lag is a vanilla issue)

## New Roles and Settings
- The Glitch from TOU-R, replacing the Glitch role from TOHRE
- Kill Cooldown after meetings setting for Greedy, Inhibitor and Saboteur
- Improved HUD
- Head Hunter settings: Minimum and Maximum Kill Cooldown
