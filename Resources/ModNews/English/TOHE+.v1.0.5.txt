## Thank you for using TOHE+!

## Fixes
- Added missing strings and fixed some minor bugs
- Security Guard now prevents door closes while using the ability
- Most shapeshifting roles that only used shapeshifting as an ability trigger or a target selector now no longer actually shapeshift! It is canceled after selecting the target, but the effect is still applied!

## New Roles and Settings
- New Role: Aid (Crewmate)
- New Role: Tether (Crewmate)
- New Role: Door Master (Crewmate)
- New Role: Ricochet (Crewmate)
- New Role: Spy (Crewmate)
