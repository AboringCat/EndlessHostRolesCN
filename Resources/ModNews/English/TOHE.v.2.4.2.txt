## New gamemode
- A brand new official gamemode, Basic FFA (Free For All)
- This mode makes everyone a killer and the last player alive wins

## Overall improvements
- Gain more ability uses for completing tasks as crewmate roles

- Prevent kills while shifted when no abiltiy uses are left for some roles (Sniper, Twister, Disperser, Hangman, Camouflager, etc.)
- Code cleanup and small performance improvement
- Improved EAC
- Better intro sounds
- Better custom button images
- Better progress text look
- Visualized cooldowns for more roles
- Disabled most shield animations for modded clients for a better experience, and even some for vanilla clients (all cooldowns are still reset properly, this is just a visual improvement)
- Shapeshift and vent cooldowns are now always reset after meetings
- Custom main menu
- Improved strings and their appearance
- More customizable settings; More reasonable default settings
- Starting Kill Cooldown setting
- Better confirm ejections text
- Brand new HUD text
- Better role summary
- Smaller mod version text and smaller credentials text (imo it was annoying that it covered a quarter of the screen)
